# Archi (Step 1)

This code is used to train the machine learning models to detect and read the pipe specs and inspection points in P&IDs.

- Clone or fork this repository. Then, store the drawings you want to digitise in the folder `..\data\images` (note that only .jpg files are accepted). Please name the files using three characters.

- Afterwards, run `Archimech.ipynb` using Google Colaboratory and run all cells. This will generate a zip file with a folder named `boxes` inside. Download the zip (using the last cell of the Colab Notebook), uncompress and copy `boxes` into [Archimech_download](https://github.com/Luistoq/Archimech_download) (step 2) to continue with the corrosion circuit marking step.
